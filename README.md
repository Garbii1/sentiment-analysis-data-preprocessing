# Data Preprocessing for Sentiment Analysis

## 1. Project Objective

This project focuses on the foundational and most critical step of any machine learning pipeline: **data preprocessing**. The primary objective is to take a raw sentiment analysis dataset (`Sentiment dataset.csv`) and transform it into a clean, structured, and numerical format that is suitable for training a classification model.

This process ensures data quality and consistency, which directly impacts the performance and reliability of any subsequent machine learning model.

## 2. Dataset

- **File:** `Sentiment dataset.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains text data from various social media platforms, along with metadata such as user information, platform, timestamps, engagement metrics (likes, retweets), and the sentiment of the text.

## 3. Preprocessing Workflow

The notebook follows a systematic approach to clean and prepare the data, involving the following key steps:

- **Data Loading and Inspection:**
    - The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
    - Initial inspection is performed using `.info()`, `.head()`, and `.describe()` to understand the structure, data types, and identify any immediate issues.

- **Handling Missing Data:**
    - A check for missing values is conducted using `df.isnull().sum()`.
    - Numerical columns with missing values (e.g., 'Retweets', 'Likes') are imputed using the *median* to avoid skewing the data with outliers.
    - Rows with missing categorical data (e.g., 'Country') are dropped due to their small number.

- **Data Cleaning:**
    - Categorical text columns, specifically the `Sentiment` column, are cleaned by stripping leading and trailing whitespace using `.str.strip()`. This is a crucial step to ensure consistency before encoding (e.g., treating `' Positive '` and `'Positive'` as the same category).

- **Encoding Categorical Variables:**
    - Machine learning models require numerical input. To facilitate this, text-based columns like `'Platform'` and `'Sentiment'` are converted into a numerical format using **One-Hot Encoding** via the pandas `get_dummies()` function.

- **Scaling Numerical Features:**
    - To ensure that features with large value ranges do not disproportionately influence the model, numerical columns are scaled.
    - **Standardization** is applied using scikit-learn's `StandardScaler`, which transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

- **Splitting the Dataset:**
    - The final preprocessed dataset is split into a training set (80% of the data) and a testing set (20% of the data) using `train_test_split`.
    - This separation is essential for training the model on one subset of data and evaluating its performance on another, completely unseen subset, which provides an unbiased assessment of the model's effectiveness.

## 4. Tools and Libraries

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**
    - **Pandas:** For data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
    - **Scikit-learn:** For preprocessing tasks, specifically `StandardScaler` and `train_test_split`.
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 5. How to Run the Code

1.  Ensure you have a Python environment with the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```
2.  Place the `Sentiment dataset.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook or upload it to your Google Colab session.
3.  Open the notebook (`.ipynb` file) in a Jupyter or Colab environment.
4.  Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.

## 6. Outcome

The script's output is a set of four fully preprocessed pandas objects: `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.
